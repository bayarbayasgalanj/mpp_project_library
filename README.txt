Changes to the project after presentation on 2023-3-11:

1. If login is successful, hide all windows and display the main window with the user's level.
2. When adding a book, if a book with the same ISBN already exists, update that book with the data from the panel. The same rule applies to adding a member.
3. Create a separate window for the due date record, accessible from the checkout window.
4. Added more exception rules for the following functions: AddAddress, AddAuthor, AddBook, and AddMember.
